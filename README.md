# ProcessMonitoringDashboard
The goal of this project is to develop a user-friendly graphical dashboard that monitors system processes in real-time, displaying key metrics like process states (e.g., running, sleeping), CPU usage, and memory consumption. The tool aims to assist administrators in tracking system performance and identifying issues such as resource-heavy processes or potential bottlenecks.


Module 1: Data Collection
Added Thread Count (num_threads) to track how many threads each process has.
Included I/O Counters (io_counters) to monitor disk read/write activity per process.
Converted I/O values from bytes to MB for better readability.
